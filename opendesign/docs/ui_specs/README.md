# UI Specification Notes

This directory documents the reconstructed UI model for the OpenDesign application. The initial focus is on parity with the legacy ribbon-driven CAD workspace. Specifications capture ribbon layouts, status bar semantics, and default panel composition.

* **Ribbon** – Categories follow the order Home, View, Tools. Each contains aligned action groups mapped to command bus identifiers.
* **Status Bar** – Displays active document metrics and command hints with an 8px padding grid.
* **Panels** – Docking layout assumes left navigation, central viewport, and right properties inspector.

Detailed specifications are expected to evolve alongside feature development.
